(2020). *Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan* (2. Ed.). Taylor and Francis, CRC Press.\n\n\n2M7. Assume again the original card problem, with a single card showing a black side face up. \nBefore looking at the other side, \nwe draw another card from the bag and lay it face up on the table. \nThe face that is shown on the new card is white. \nShow that the probability that the first card, the one showing a black side, \nhas black on its other side is now 0.75. Use the counting method, if you can. \nHint: Treat this like the sequence of globe tosses, \ncounting all the ways to see each observation, for each possiible first card.\n\n\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n# Solution\n\nLet's label the cards *bb* (black on both sides), *bw* (black on one, white on the other), and *ww* (both sides are white), respectively.\n\nTo keep things straigt, here's visualization of our data.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Rethink_2m7_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_07109b1185c47f7c1960bd3afb1b889b'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-pos='H' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWanted is the probability $Pr(c1=bb|1b,2w)$, the probability of drawing (as card 1) a *bb*  card, given that we observerd b in the first draw, denoted as *1b*, and a white card in the second draw, denoted as *2w*.\n\n\nLet's draw a tree diagram for easier comprehension.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Rethink_2m7_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_4a668a4c51bb429278278d9c2be01c0d'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-1ff374ff5dc8b0c93a1c\" style=\"width:100%;height:237.312px;\" class=\"DiagrammeR html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-1ff374ff5dc8b0c93a1c\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"graph LR\\n  A[Start] -->B[_b_b]\\n  E ---M[valid]\\n  A -->C[b_b_]\\n  A -->D[_b_w]\\n  B -->E[_w_w]\\n  B -->F[w_w_]\\n  B --> F2[b_w_]\\n  F2 --- F3[valid]\\n  F --- N[valid]\\n  B -->K[_b_w]\\n  K ---O[invalid]\\n  C -->G[_w_w]\\n  G ---P[valid]\\n  C -->H[w_w_]\\n  H ---Q[valid]\\n  C -->L[_b_w]\\n  C -->L2[b_w_]\\n  L2 ---L3[valid]\\n  L ---R[invalid]\\n  D -->I[_w_w]\\n  I ---S[valid]\\n  D -->J[w_w_]\\n  J ---T[valid]\\n  A -->U[w_w_]\\n  U-.-2[invalid]\\n  A -->V[_w_w]\\n  V -.-V2[invalid]\\n  \"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the diagram, the symbol \"_b_w\" means that *b*lack face of a the bw-card (one black, one white face) was drawn. \nSimilarly, \"_b_b\" means that one (of the two) *b*lack faces of the bb-card (two black faces) was drawn.\n\n\nHere, we have to consider two cards. Let's use this notation *ww-bb* for the sequence \"first card is white on both sides, second card is black on both sides\".\n\nThe data observed is: first card has one black side, the second card has one white side, i.,e *b-w*.\n\n\n\nLooking at the tree, we realize that out of all 8  paths, 6 feature the *bb* card as first card:\n\n$Pr(1bb|b,w) = 6/8 = 3/4 = 0.75$\n\nwhere `1bb` means \"card 1 is black on both sides\", and `b,w` means \"first draw showed a *b*lack face, and second card showed a *w*hite face\".\n\n\nIn other words, there are 8 valid paths in the tree diagram, out of which 6 belong the the hypothesis that the first card is all black.    \n\nAs a Bayes-Grid (or \"Bayes-Box\") we can depict the situation like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Rethink_2m7_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_e7c362d773bfbeafdb9ab83ee8241871'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Hyp | Prior|  L| unstand_Post|Post |\n|:---|-----:|--:|------------:|:----|\n|bb  |     1|  6|            6|3/4  |\n|bw  |     1|  2|            2|1/4  |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOr, equally valid, realizihg that there are the events of the card \"bb\":\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Rethink_2m7_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_db9945b441869c319aea515156ed9843'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Hyp | Prior|  L| unstand_Post|Post |\n|:---|-----:|--:|------------:|:----|\n|bb  |     2|  3|            6|3/4  |\n|bw  |     1|  2|            2|1/4  |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, using probability, and not counts:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Rethink_2m7_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_37391d6e745960ae2cac0535c1086362'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Hyp | Prior|L   |unstand_Post |Post |\n|:---|-----:|:---|:------------|:----|\n|bb  |     2|3/4 |6/4          |3/4  |\n|bw  |     1|2/4 |2/4          |1/4  |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhenever the probability of all paths (in a tree diagram) is the same, as it is the case in the present example, we do not need to write down the probability of the path for the likelihood. It is enough to write the number of paths (of course we can if we want).\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nCategories: \n\n- probability\n- bayes\n\n",

(2020). *Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan* (2. Ed.). Taylor and Francis, CRC Press.\n\n\n2M7. Assume again the original card problem, with a single card showing a black side face up. \nBefore looking at the other side, \nwe draw another card from the bag and lay it face up on the table. \nThe face that is shown on the new card is white. \nShow that the probability that the first card, the one showing a black side, \nhas black on its other side is now 0.75. Use the counting method, if you can. \nHint: Treat this like the sequence of globe tosses, \ncounting all the ways to see each observation, for each possiible first card.\n\n\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n# Solution\n\nLet's label the cards *bb* (black on both sides), *bw* (black on one, white on the other), and *ww* (both sides are white), respectively.\n\nWanted is the probability $Pr(c1=bb|1b)$, the probability of drawing (as card 1) a *bb*  card, given that we observerd b in the first draw, denoted as *1b*.\n\n\n\nHere, we have to consider two cards. Let's use this notation *ww-bb* for the sequence \"first card is white on both sides, second card is black on both sides\".\n\nThe data observed is: first card has one black side, the second card has one white side, i.,e *b-w*.\n\nConsider the following simple \"tree diagram\" showing the paths according to the four hypothesis, first level denotes the first card, the second (more indented) denotes the second card:\n\n*Hyp. A: bb-ww*:\n\n- b\n    - w\n    - w\n- b\n    - w\n    - w\n\nThere are 4 paths consistend with the data, *b-w*.\n\n\n*Hyp. B: bw-ww*:\n\n- b\n    - w\n    - w\n- w\n    - w\n    - w\n    \nThere are 2 paths consistent with the data,* b-w*.\n\n\n\n*Hyp. A: bb-bw*:\n\n- b\n    - b\n    - w\n- b\n    - b\n    - w\n    \nThere are 2 paths consistent with the data.+, *b-w*.\n\n\nLooking at the tree, we realize that out of all 8 allowed paths, 6 feature the *bb* card as first card:\n\n$Pr(c1=bb|b-w) = 6/8 = 3/4 = 0.75$\n\nwhere `c1` means \"card 1\", and `b-w` means \"first draw showed a *b* side, and second card showed a *w* face\".\n\n\nAs for an other approach, consider \nthe solution taken from [this source](https://sr2-solutions.wjakethompson.com/bayesian-inference.html).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Rethink_2m7_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_29ea88da84365f3e16c1033a3e658b0e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 2 choices for first card (either bw or bb), with 3 options for second card: 2 ww + 1 bw\ncard_bb_likelihood <- 2 * 3 \ncard_wb_likelihood <- 1 * 2 \ncard_ww_likelihood <- 0\n\nlikelihood <- c(card_bb_likelihood, card_wb_likelihood, card_ww_likelihood)\nprior <- c(1,1,1)\nposterior <- prior * likelihood\nposterior <- posterior / sum(posterior)\n\nposterior[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.75\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nCategories: \n\n- probability\n- bayes\n\n",
